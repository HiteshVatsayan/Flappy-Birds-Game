# Flappy-Birds-Game
This is a Flappy Bird clone developed using the libGDX framework, a popular open-source game development framework for Java. The game follows the same gameplay mechanics as the original Flappy Bird game, where the player controls a bird and tries to navigate through a series of pipes without colliding with them.
